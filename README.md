# ðŸš¦ Day 02 â€“ Traffic Light Controller using LEDs

## ðŸ“… Project Overview
This project simulates a basic traffic light controller using three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green). The lights turn on in a timed sequence just like a real-world traffic signal. This is part of a 30-day embedded systems self-internship.

## ðŸ’¡ Working Principle
The Arduino runs a continuous loop:
1. Green light turns ON for 5 seconds (vehicles can go)
2. Yellow light turns ON for 2 seconds (prepare to stop)
3. Red light turns ON for 5 seconds (vehicles stop)

This cycle repeats indefinitely.
